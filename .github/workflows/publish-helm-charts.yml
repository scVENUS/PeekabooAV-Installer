    # dependency races the gh-pages build and deployment workflow. It appears
    # that his job will not do anything if the charts job created any new
    # release, which created a tag relative to which the pipeline chart most
    # likely did not change. Another change and push can then trigger just the
    # pipeline chart publishing.
