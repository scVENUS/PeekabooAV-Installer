# here it gets somewhat fancy: below code allows to set arbitrary config
# options from environment variables by scanning and interpreting them
# according to the following rules:
#
# - variable name needs to start with RSPAMD_CONFIG_
# - the last component is the name of the setting to place into the config
# - the variable value is the setting value
#     RSPAMD_CONFIG_setting="value" -> setting = value;
#   (note the missing quotes)
#
# - string values that are to end up quoted in the config file need are denoted
#   by ending the variable name in a single underscore:
#     RSPAMD_CONFIG_setting_="value" -> setting = "value";
#   (note the quotes present)
#
# - section names are separated from values using double underscores:
#     RSPAMD_CONFIG_section__setting="value"
#     RSPAMD_CONFIG_section__section2__setting2_="value2"
#     ->
#     section {
#       setting = value;
#       section2 {
#         setting2 = "value";
#       }
#     }
#
# - arrays can be given in short notation as values:
#     RSPAMD_CONFIG_array="['value1', 'value2']"
#     -> array = ['value1', 'value2'];
#
# - arrays can also be given in multiple variables distinguished and ordered by
#   at least double digits in front of the option name:
#     RSPAMD_CONFIG_01_array="value1"
#     RSPAMD_CONFIG_02_array="value2"
#     ->
#     array = [
#       value1,
#       value2
#     ];
#   (note the missing quotes around the values - go underscore for strings)
#
# To put all this to use one has to know the layout of the rspamd configuration
# object tree. Unfortunately it's somewhat obscured by the way its buildup is
# (somewhat inconsistently) delegated to various include files. That's also why
# we don't even try to use these individual config files as targets for our
# output here. This is an excerpt of what we've been interested in so far:
#
# options {
#   filters = "";
# }
#
# group {
#   antivirus {
#     symbols {
#       IDENTIFIER {
#         weight: 4.0 ...
#
# -> group settings are inconsistent in the stock config in that they delegate
# to a groups.conf but still configure individual group objects starting at the
# top level of the tree.
#
# force_actions {
#   rules {
#     IDENTIFIER {
#       action: "reject" ...

# generate our config overrides over the distributed configuration. We put it
